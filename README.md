## Branching Strategy
-> GitHub Flow Strategy. It focuses on Agile principles and so it is a fast and streamlined branching strategy with short production cycles and frequent releases, also allows for fast feedback loops so that one can quickly identify issues and resolve them.

## .gitignore file
-> the .gitignore file gonna list the names of files that can be found in work-trees when working in the project, but that should not be committed to the project (e.g sensitive information about the user) 

## Storage of credentials and sensitive information
-> They will be encypted and stored in a gitignore file which will not be commit to githib to avoid licks
